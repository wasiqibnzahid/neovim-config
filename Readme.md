# Configuring tmux

The config is stored here in the file, if using linux the tmux config, create a symlink using the following command to store a pointer to the file in the home directory so that the config is loaded

```
 ln -s <src_directory> .tmux.conf
```

In most cases src would be ~/.config/nvim/.tmux.conf

# Reference

Make sure to store the vim config source directory under the name $VIM_CONF, easier to access
Add it in source bashrc file

```
 export VIM_CONF="${HOME}/.config/nvim"
```
